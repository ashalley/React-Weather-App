Hello. Here is my weather app for the code challenge.

Unfortunately, hit a wall for the 5-day Forecast.

The data populates when the button is clicked, but ran into issues getting the information to display correctly. I placed in 'JSON.stringify(responseObjs)' and turned off the Error and Loading functions in the 'WeeklyForecast' component to show that data is coming in from the API call and is working correctly there. Ended up creating another component showing the data displaying as I intended, but the city isn't a dynamic variable. I set it to "Detroit" for this demo.

That being said, I would love to learn what I did wrong and how to fix it. One of my favorite things about code is that there is so much to learn and improve upon.
